# Yeet Mod

Minecraft Survival Mod that adds a basic drinking and hydration system that has been completely over-engineered to be a project for school.

## :package: Installation

Will be added soon!

## :hammer_and_wrench: Development

First of all, you need to have two Java dependencies installed on your computer. As this mod was created using [Forge 1.19.2 - 43.2.0](https://files.minecraftforge.net/net/minecraftforge/forge/) for the Minecraft Java Edition.

### Dependencies

1. [Java 8](https://www.java.com/download/ie_manual.jsp)
2. [Java JDK 19](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/)

### Setting up the IDE

This mod was created using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) as the editor. We will only explain how to set it up there; if you would like to use any other editor like InteliJ or Eclipse, feel free to do so.

### Recommended extensions

If you first open the project in VSCode, the editor should automatically ask you to install the recommended extensions because they have been added to the [Workspace Recommendations](./.vscode/extensions.json) file. If not, manually search for them in the extensions tab or install via the provided links below.

1. [Extension Pack for Java](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscjava.vscode-java-pack)
2. [Gradle for Java](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscjava.vscode-gradle)

### Run Gradle for project configuration

First, you need to configure the project. To do this, simply open VSCode if you have installed the recommended extensions, or run the following command in your terminal.

```
./gradlew
```

### Run Gradle task for IDE setup (autocompletion etc,)

Navigate to the Gradle extension in VSCode and run the following task:

```
Tasks > ide > eclipse
```

*You won't have to use Eclipse; it is only used to download all files needed for efficient development.*
